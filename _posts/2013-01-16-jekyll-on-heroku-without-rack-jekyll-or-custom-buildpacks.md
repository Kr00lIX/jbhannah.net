title:     Jekyll on Heroku without Rack::Jekyll or custom buildpacks
published: true
---

For a while now, this site has been hosted on [Heroku][] as static files
generated by [Jekyll][], which is much faster than either my old
WordPress blog or my previous Rails-based site (even with caching). Most
sets of instructions for deploying Jekyll sites to Heroku either say to
use [Rack::Jekyll][] and commit the site's compiled static files into
Git, or to use a [custom Heroku buildpack][] to compile the site at
deploy time. I wanted to stick as close to the default Heroku setup as
possible without cluttering the repository with compiled pages, and
Rack::Jekyll is unnecessarily complicated when [Rack::TryStatic works
just fine][].

## Compiling on deployment

[Heroku's Ruby buildpack][] looks by default for the Rake task
`assets:precompile` and runs it if it finds it. This is typically for
the [Rails asset pipeline][] to precompile [CoffeeScript][] files,
[Compass][] stylesheets, &c., but any site that uses the Ruby buildpack
can add a task with the same name to its Rakefile and have it run every
time the site is pushed to Heroku. It turns out this is perfect for
compiling Jekyll pages:

{% gist 4551206 Rakefile %}

## Serving from Rack

Once they've been compiled by Heroku, the static files are served up by
[Unicorn][] and a pair of [Rack::Contrib][] modules: `try_static` and
`not_found`. `try_static` lets Rack serve up static HTML files and
tries to match specified paths, and `not_found` tells Rack to serve a
specific file in the event of a 404 error. Add `rack_contrib` to the
`Gemfile` and write a Rackup file as follows:

{% gist 4551206 config.ru %}

Finally, create a `Procfile` with a web task for Heroku to run your
server of choice, such as Unicorn (assuming you have added `unicorn` to
your `Gemfile` and configured it appropriately):

{% gist 4551206 Procfile %}

The [entire source of this site][] is available on GitHub, so you can
see there how I've [configured Unicorn][], my [Gemfile][], &c., as a
basis for your own deployment.

**Updated 2013-02-06:** I'm now using [`jekyll-assets`][] to handle
compiling Compass and CoffeeScript files as part of Jekyll's own build
process. I've updated this post and its associated Gist to reflect this
by removing the separate commands for and references to Compass.
